# PiMessages

A messaging tool for the terminal

*Note: Please do only use this tool for fun, becasue it's made by a stupid 12 year old.*

## How PiMessages works:

First, you need to create an account with an unique username and secure password.
Then, you can write messages to other users, and if you don't want to get any more
messages from them, you can ignore them. If you want to try this out, continue
reading in the ```Setup``` section.
